                        My name is Samuel Segun aka <strong><i> <abrr title="Segun John Samuel">SJ Samuel</abrr></i></strong>. 
                        I am an Engineer, an educationist, a Health, Safety and Environment Specialist, a life-time student, and now a web developer in the making. 
                        I hold several qualifications, but would only mention just a few which you would come across as you read through my page.
                        Some simply call me Sam Sam. Which ever one you like, you are welcome to my homepage. 
                        I am an Engineer by training, but I am diversified in experience.  
                        I have interest in some many aspects of life, and so focusing on a single thing 
                        has been one of my greatest challenges. 
                        <br>
                        I love to know everything and do everything.I was raised in a village, and grew up as a farmer. 
                        If there is anything that I would love to do at the later end of my life,
                        I think that should be farming. I love growing and seeing flowers, 
                        plants of different sorts and maybe this is why I am a vegetarian.

                        <p>
                            Unlike many people, my parents could not afford to enroll me in a public school,
                            so I attended a typical village school, where I was taught in a local dialect
                            (Yoruba) from  Primary one to Primary 6. Well, some people would say 
                            that they were not born with a silver spoon. Like I would always say 
                            <b>
                            <blockquote>“ they are better off for at least having a spoon. I was neither born with any. Not
                            even with a <mark>wooden spoon,</mark> talkless of a <mark>bronze</mark> or <mark>silver.</mark>
                            ”</blockquote></b> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any way, I thank God for at least attending a school. 
                            My grandfather, who never went to school for a day, 
                            taught me how to read and write. Yes!!! I could read and 
                            write, but to compose a simple sentence in English Language was a hard task,
                            aside from the general “come”, “go”, “see”, etc. My teachers were good, 
                            but whether they can speak
                            English or not is what I can't  tell. </p>
                                
                        <p>
                            I always watched my peers who went to private schools in amazement 
                            when they communicated in English. I remember asking myself when 
                            would I become one of these people, too. They were all like a tiny “white god” to
                            me who should be worshipped because they could speak English fluently 
                            while I was not.  Although I topped the class  throughout my elementary
                            education after I had repeated Primary One, 
                            I needed to put in extra effort to be able to communicate in English.
                            So, don’t be surprised if you ask me what my greatest achievement 
                            is if I told you it is the ability to Speak English.

                        <h3 class="center-align-text">Education</h3>
                        <p>
                           I studied Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University  
                           of Ilorin and graduated with Second Class Upper. 
                           I realized that I found it easy to teach others and 
                           they usually get to understand whatever I taught them. </p>
                        <p> 
                           So, after my graduation, during my National 
                           Youth Service Corps (NYSC)- a mandatory national youth service in my country,
                           I decided to enroll for a course in Arts and Social Science.
                           This time around, it was a postgraduate diploma in education, 
                           where I took courses such as Philosophy of Education, 
                           Educational Psychology, History of Education, Sociology of Education,
                           etc. </p>
                        <p>
                           I found the programme very interesting, first because 
                           it is totally outside my technical background and also because 
                           it helped me to learn the process involved in human learning. 
                           During this time, I was also teaching in a private Secondary 
                           School and also as a teaching assistant in a Federal Polytechnic.
                           It was therefore of utmost interest to me applying what 
                           I was learning from the programme and seeing it working 
                           in the classes that I took.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           After this programe, I took an offer to work as a 
                           Health and Safety Officer in one of the largest power 
                           companies in my country. In the course of relating with workers,
                           I began to notice a myriad of social problems and suddenly I realized that I needed to 
                           go back to engineering school, After all, the 
                           essence of engineering is to solve human problems. </p>
                        <p>
                           Specifically, one of the 
                           issues that came to mind then was the challenges usually confronting
                           the independence and the autonomy of the people with blindness and  
                           low-vision. I enrolled immediately for a master’s degree in Electrical 
                           and Electronic Engineering in the University of Ibadan. I devoted of 
                           my school hours to researching on technologies to alleviate the 
                           conditions of people with visual impairments. </p>
                        <p>
                           My current PhD research is still along this direction in one of the top universities 
                           in North America. Now, I am learning web development with 
                           SkillHat and one of my goals is to learn how to develop accessible 
                           and interactive user interfaces for the blind. To be continued …</p>
