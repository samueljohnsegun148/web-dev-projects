## Project Description
This web app generates a password when the button is clicked. The user receives a series of prompts for password criteria such as the lenght of the password, which must satisfy the minimum 8 characters and maximum 128 characters criteria. The user should atleast select one of the four character options to be included. These options are lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters.

Once the criteria are fulfilled, the password would be generated and displayed on the page for the user.
