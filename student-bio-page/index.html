                        My name is Samuel Segun aka <strong><i> <abrr title="Segun John Samuel">SJ Samuel</abrr></i></strong>. I am an Engineer, an educationist, a 
                        Health, Safety and Environment Specialist, a life-time student, and now a web developer in the making. 
                        I hold several qualifications, but would only mention just a few which you would come across as you read through my page.
                        Some simply call me Sam Sam. Which ever one you like, you are welcome to my homepage. 
                        I am an Engineer by training, but I am diversified in experience.  
                        I have interest in some many aspects of life, and so focusing on a single thing 
                        has been one of my greatest challenges.

                        I love to know everything and do everything.I was raised in a village, and grew up as a farmer. 
                        If there is anything that I would love to do at the later end of my life,
                        I think that should be farming. I love growing and seeing flowers, 
                        plants of different sorts and maybe this is why I am a vegetarian. <a href="../bio-page/index.html"> Read More</a>
